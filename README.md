# Coffee_Shop_Ratings

Our project is focused on what influences a metropolitan coffee shop’s average Yelp rating. From a dataset that consists of data from all Yelp businesses, user data, and reviews from 8 metropolitan areas, we cleaned and analyzed the data to include the factors we were most interested in: noise level, wifi availability, parking accessibility, outdoor seating, weekend availability, and outlet availability. 

Then we used word clouds, graph visualizations, correlation matrix, and descriptive statistics to identify common trends. Some of the most important trends we saw from our EDA and text analysis was that louder coffee shops had significantly lower ratings than quieter coffee shops, coffee shops without outdoor seating are typically rated lower, and coffee shops with no wifi were more likely to have higher ratings, compared to coffee shops with free wifi. We found that coffee shops’ noise levels had the highest correlation with higher Yelp ratings.
